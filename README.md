# ReducingtrafficusingCo-DQL
Traffic congestion is becoming an increasing issue in city environments, especially in large cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru, where travel times often take up much of the day. As cities grow and more people own cars, existing nfrastructures find it challenging to meet the rising needs. In reaction, cities globally are implementing various methods to reduce congestion and enhance movement. These include expanding roadways, constructing runways, and improving public transport systems. Furthermore, cities are increasingly embracing advanced technologies like self-driving vehicles, live traffic monitoring, and smart traffic management systems. The implementation of machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) in traffic signal control and flow optimization constitutes a significant advancement in traffic efficiency. These AI-powered methods allow for adaptable traffic light timing, predictive modeling, and route planning to relieve congestion in real-time. Additionally, traffic advisory systems available through mobile apps and radio broadcasts give commuters prompt updates about major traffic issues, enabling route changes that help reduce traffic jams. In this paper, we propose employing a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, known as Cooperative double Q-learning (Co-DQL), to optimize large-scale traffic signal control. Co-DQL applies independent double Q-learning with dual estimators and the UCB policy to enhance scalability and minimize overestimation. It utilizes mean-field approximation to model agent interactions for improved cooperation and introduces reward allocation and local state sharing for stability. We analyze its convergence properties. Experiments using traffic simulators demonstrate that Co-DQL surpasses cutting-edge decentralized MARL algorithms across various metrics by addressing larger problems and enhancing cooperative learning among agents.
